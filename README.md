3. Open `index.html` in your favourite browser – no server needed.

> 💡 If some images are missing, the CSS includes fallback styling so the layout still looks decent.

## 📁 File Structure

- `index.html` – main structure, includes header, hero, cards, footer.
- `style.css` – all the fresh styling (gradients, glass, hover effects).
- `script.js` – keeps your original scroll & arrow‑key logic, plus a tiny extra hover tweak.
- `Images/` – folder for your images.

## 🎨 Customisation

- **Background image** – replace `watch.jpeg` with your own. The overlay gradient is in the `body` background.
- **Logo** – swap out `roman-numeral-logo-design.jpg`.
- **Colours** – edit the CSS variables (they’re spread throughout, but you’ll quickly spot the pastel palette).
- **Content** – the hero text and cards are just examples; change them to suit your needs.

## 📝 Notes

- The original JavaScript (scroll effect + arrow key navigation) is untouched – we only added a tiny extra hover transition for the cards.
- The “student aesthetic” means things are a little playful: handwritten‑style highlight, rounded corners everywhere, and a soft, friendly colour scheme.
- If you want to remove the Font Awesome dependency, just delete the icons and the link in the `<head>`.
