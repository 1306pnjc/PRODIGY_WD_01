# 06 – Rebranded Student Project

A fresh, playful take on an old project – originally built 2–3 years ago, now redesigned with a modern “student aesthetic”.  
Soft gradients, rounded elements, glass‑morphism, and a touch of whimsy. The vibe is friendly, experimental, and just a little bit sketchy (in the best way).

## ✨ Features

- **Sticky header with glass effect** – blurs the background, changes colour on scroll.
- **Smooth navigation** – hover animations, pill‑shaped buttons.
- **Login / Sign‑up buttons** – with playful shadows and transitions.
- **Arrow key scrolling** – press ↑ or ↓ to move the page in small steps (prevents default cursor movement).
- **Responsive design** – looks good on mobile too (navigation adjusts).
- **Hero section + card grid** – sample content that shows off the new aesthetic.
- **Background image overlay** – the original `watch.jpeg` is preserved but softened with a gradient overlay for better readability.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, backdrop‑filter, transitions)
- JavaScript (vanilla – scroll event, key handling)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) – Inter & Caveat
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) – icons (optional but adds charm)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Make sure you have the following folder structure:

3. Open `index.html` in your favourite browser – no server needed.

> 💡 If some images are missing, the CSS includes fallback styling so the layout still looks decent.

## 📁 File Structure

- `index.html` – main structure, includes header, hero, cards, footer.
- `style.css` – all the fresh styling (gradients, glass, hover effects).
- `script.js` – keeps your original scroll & arrow‑key logic, plus a tiny extra hover tweak.
- `Images/` – folder for your images.

## 🎨 Customisation

- **Background image** – replace `watch.jpeg` with your own. The overlay gradient is in the `body` background.
- **Logo** – swap out `roman-numeral-logo-design.jpg`.
- **Colours** – edit the CSS variables (they’re spread throughout, but you’ll quickly spot the pastel palette).
- **Content** – the hero text and cards are just examples; change them to suit your needs.

## 📝 Notes

- The original JavaScript (scroll effect + arrow key navigation) is untouched – we only added a tiny extra hover transition for the cards.
- The “student aesthetic” means things are a little playful: handwritten‑style highlight, rounded corners everywhere, and a soft, friendly colour scheme.
- If you want to remove the Font Awesome dependency, just delete the icons and the link in the `<head>`.
